**ISMRM Workshop on Motion Detection and Correction 2022**<br/>
*Gastao Cruz and Thomas Kuestner*<br/>

In this hands-on of the [ISMRM Workshop on Motion Detection and Correction 2022](https://www.ismrm.org/workshops/2022/Motion/), we aim to convey the principles of motion artifacts, their appearance in the MR image, means of estimating motion (conventional and deep learning) and correcting for the induced motion artifacts.

Supporting codebase and data for motion correction are supplied in this repository. Python codes are provided to execute and experiment with different motion correction strategies inside a Jupyter notebook. For the motion-compensated image reconstruction, we additionally provide Matlab code.

## Syllabus
### Target audience
MR scientists interested in advanced motion estimation and correction techniques. After completing this workshop, the participants should be able to:
-	Understand how motion affects MR acquisition and reconstruction
-	Understand existing approaches to deal with motion
-	Understand and perform motion estimation including deep learning-based solutions
-	Understand and perform motion corrected reconstructions

### Outline
We will study the problem of motion in MR, starting with the various sources of motion in MR and how they impact the acquisition and reconstruction processes. Various types of motion models and physiological motion challenges will be considered, along with the typical artefacts encountered and general prospective and retrospective approaches to deal with motion<sup>1</sup>. The mechanisms behind motion artefacts will be described, recognizing motion artefacts as superposition of aliased images in different motion states. The impact of motion artifacts on Cartesian and non-Cartesian acquisitions will be illustrated as well as means to correct for it.

The first component of this workshop will be talks covering the fundamentals of motion in MR, with a strong focus on retrospective motion correction strategies<sup>2</sup>, including deep learning-based solutions. The generalized forward model for an MR acquisition considering motion will be introduced<sup>3</sup>. This model will be used to: 1) characterize the profile of the aliasing introduced due to motion and understand how the relationship between the geometry of the motion and the geometry of the sampling trajectory determines these artefacts; 2) provide a reconstruction model to correct for generalized motion occurring during the MR acquisition. The talks will further discuss practical and general approaches to estimate and correct for motion, including techniques like triggering and gating<sup>4,5</sup>, motion binning<sup>6</sup>, image registration<sup>7-9</sup>, k-space motion correction<sup>10</sup>, deep learning-based image registration<sup>11,12</sup> and motion corrected reconstruction<sup>3,9</sup>.

The second component of this workshop will include a hands-on tutorial with code examples focusing on retrospective motion correction which covers three aspects: motion artifact appearance, motion estimation via image registration and motion corrected reconstructions. First, we will analyse different types of motion artefacts, evaluating their behaviour in the context of different motion model geometries (e.g. translation, rigid, affine, etc) and different trajectories (e.g. Cartesian, radial, etc). Second, we will experiment with image registration tools for motion estimation and investigate their performance in various scenarios. Third, we will implement a motion corrected reconstruction and study the properties of that model in the presence of noise, undersampling or model errors. We will apply all these approaches to real in-vivo cases.

After completing this workshop, the attendees should have a better understanding of how motion affects MR acquisitions, the type of artefacts it can introduce, existing strategies for dealing with motion, and get practical experience in retrospective motion estimation and correction.
